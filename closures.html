#Finding closure with closures

## Thomas Ballinger
## @ballingt

???
* A friend of mine was asked what are closures was at a programming interview a few years ago.
Who here would have something to say in response to that question?
My friend was pretty competent with Python and JavaScript and took advantage of closures in his code all the time. I hope today we leave here with something to say on that topic if we're asked.

* I worked for several years at a programming retreat where programmers more familiar with other languages would sometimes ask me "does Python even have closures?" I hope we leave here with something to say to that as well.

---
class: huge center

#spoiler: yes

class: listitemsfillwidth

* how free variables get resolved
* how Python determines variable scope
* Python 1.0 functions: not quite closures
* Python 2.2 function: they're closures now
* Python 3.0 function: now with more closure
* how we use closures

???
To find that closure, we'll look at...

---

???
I have two functions for formatting strings.
One is for html, the other is for outputting text to the terminal.
(you know, the way text in the terminal is sometimes different colors)

I'm going to import these two functions, then look at their source code
with the inspect module, a Python standard library module.

---
class: widecode

~~~
>>> 
~~~

???
I'm going to open up the interactive Python interpreter

---
class: widecode

~~~
>>> from htmlformat import bold as htmlbold
>>> from terminalformat import bold as termbold
>>>
~~~
???
I have to use the "from, import, as" syntax because these functions have the same name

---
class: widecode

~~~
>>> from htmlformat import bold as htmlbold
>>> from terminalformat import bold as termbold
>>> import inspect
>>>







~~~
???
and now using the inspect module,

---
class: widecode

~~~
>>> from htmlformat import bold as htmlbold
>>> from terminalformat import bold as termbold
>>> import inspect
*>>> print(inspect.getsource(htmlbold))
*def bold(text):
*   return '{}{}{}'.format(BOLDBEFORE, text, BOLDAFTER)

>>>




~~~
???
we'll look at the code for the first function, which looks like a simple one-liner,

---
class: widecode

~~~
>>> from htmlformat import bold as htmlbold
>>> from terminalformat import bold as termbold
>>> import inspect
>>> print(inspect.getsource(htmlbold))
def bold(text):
    return '{}{}{}'.format(BOLDBEFORE, text, BOLDAFTER)

*>>> print(inspect.getsource(termbold))
*def bold(text):
*   return '{}{}{}'.format(BOLDBEFORE, text, BOLDAFTER)

>>>
~~~
???
and the second. They're remarkably similar!

---
class: widecode


~~~
def bold(text):
    return '{}{}{}'.format(BOLDBEFORE, text, BOLDAFTER)

def bold(text):
    return '{}{}{}'.format(BOLDBEFORE, text, BOLDAFTER)
~~~

???
But when I use them, they're going to have different behavior.

---

~~~
*>>> htmlbold('eggplant')
*'<b>eggplant</b>'
>>>


~~~

---

~~~
>>> htmlbold('eggplant')
'<b>eggplant</b>'
*>>> termbold('eggplant')
*'\x1b[1meggplant\x1b[0m'
>>>
~~~

---

???
How is that possible? How are the two functions different?
Here's a similar question: the html bold function uses
the variable `BOLDBEFORE`.

---
class: widecode

~~~
>>> print(inspect.getsource(htmlbold))
def bold(text):
*   return '{}{}{}'.format(BOLDBEFORE, text, BOLDAFTER)
~~~


???
Because it is neither a parameter to the function
nor a local variable, we call it a "free variable."

---

~~~
>>> from htmlformat import bold as htmlbold
>>> def signbold(phrase):
...     BEFOREBOLD = '(in Sharpie) '
...     return htmlbold(phrase)
...
>>> signbold('eggplant')
~~~

???
If we call that function after setting a local variable with that name,
will that change its behavior? 

will it output `'<b>eggplant</b>'` or `'(in Sharpie) eggplant</b>'`?

The question amounts to whether the Python language uses "open free
variables," whose values are determined by looking up the call
stack, or with closed free variables that use the value in the environment
in which the function was defined.

---
background-image: url(./theFunctionOfFunction.png)


???
In a 1970 paper describing implementing these two approaches,
Joel Moses points out that although it might be easier to implement a language with
the first behavior, programmers are usually interested in the second; they
want their functions to use the variables they created for use with that
function, not new variables at their functions' call sites.
---

~~~
>>> from htmlformat import bold as htmlbold
>>> def signbold(phrase):
...     BEFOREBOLD = '(in Sharpie) '
...     return htmlbold(phrase)
...
*>>> signbold('eggplant')
~~~

???
With that in mind, will "in Sharpie" print here, or will we get the old behavior of the bold tags?

---

~~~
>>> from htmlformat import bold as htmlbold
>>> def signbold(phrase):
...     BEFOREBOLD = '(in Sharpie) '
...     return htmlbold(phrase)
...
>>> signbold('eggplant')
*'<b>eggplant</b>'
~~~

???
And indeed, Python ignores this new variable and bold tags again sandwich
the word eggplant.

---
~~~
>>> from htmlformat import bold as htmlbold
*>>> BEFOREBOLD = '(in Sharpie) '
>>>
~~~

???
What about changing the global variable instead?

---

~~~
>>> from htmlformat import bold as htmlbold
>>> BEFOREBOLD = '(in Sharpie) '
>>> htmlbold('eggplant')
~~~

???
What will this print?

It's either "in Sharpie" or "b tag".

---

~~~
>>> from htmlformat import bold as htmlbold
>>> BEFOREBOLD = '(in Sharpie) '
>>> htmlbold('eggplant')
'<b>eggplant</b>'
~~~

???
That's right, these are different global variables!

And now we have a hint of how those two bold functions
might differ, let's finally take a look.

*AFTERBOLD = '</b>'               AFTERBOLD = '\x1b[0m'

def bold(text):                  def bold(text):
    return '{}{}{}'.format(          return '{}{}{}'.format(
      BOLDBEFORE,                      BOLDBEFORE,
      text,                            text,
      BOLDAFTER)                       BOLDAFTER)
~~~


???
Different global variables, and it seems like they each use their own global variables!
"global" is not a great name.

---
class: huge center

#global variables aren't

???
They aren't universal across your whole program,
they're really module level variables.

---

???
Since we're stuck with the word "global," we should
think of each module as being a separate globe...

And function objects imported from modules are emissaries from their home
modules, always in communication with their homeworld.

---

```python
>>> from htmlformat import bold
*>>> bold.__module__
'htmlformat'




```

???
On the function object we find references both to the name of the module
where it was defined, and more importantly to the dictionary of the global
variables in the module.

---

```python
>>> from htmlformat import bold
>>> bold.__module__
'htmlformat'
*>>> bold.__globals__.keys()
dict_keys(['BEFOREBOLD', 'AFTERBOLD', 'bold',
'__name__', '__builtins__', '__cached__',
'__spec__', '__package__', '__doc__',
'__loader__', '__file__'])

'__name__', '__builtins__', '__cached__',
'__spec__', '__package__', '__doc__',
'__loader__', '__file__'])
>>> import htmlformat
*>>> vars(htmlformat) is bold.__globals__
True

```

???
The other important thing about this is that
this is a live link back to that home planet!
It's the very same object as the namespace of the module!


---
background-image: url(./theFunctionOfFunction.png)

???
In that same paper, Joel Moses described an implementation of this type of behavior.
For a function to behave this way, it needs both the code it will execute and the environment
which closes the free variables used by that function.

He called this...

---
class: huge center

#Closure:
#code + environment

???
A closure! A closure is the combination of code and the data structure storing the
environment in which to look up the free variables in that code.

So Python functions are looking an awful lot like closures!

---

???
Because this is a live link to that module, what if we were to change a binding in that namespace?

Will this print with bold or the new span tags surrounding it?

---
~~~
>>> from htmlformat import bold

'<span class="bold">eggplant</span>
>>>
~~~

???
The function is going to use the new values because it uses the value of the
variables when we call the function, not when we define the function.

So if we step through,

---

The distinction between function definition time and function execution
time because important with this live link behavior: as you can see, the
value it determined at execution time, but Python analyzes code when the function
is defined and determines the scope of each variable.

class: huge center

# Identifying the scope of a variable

???
A Python function object is the result of this process, with each
of its attribute storing a different piece of
information about the function.

--

#`bold.__code__`

???
Most of the most interesting stuff is on the `__code__` object

---

???
For as long as Python has been available on the internet,
there have been at least two kinds of variables:

---
class: center

# local variables: `func.__code__.co_varnames`
# "phone home" global variables: `func.__code__.co_names`

???
Local variables (including function parameters) appear in `.__code__.co_varnames`
and global variables and a few other things make up `.__code__.co_names`.

---

???
You may already have some good intuition for this, so
let's be the interpreter and look for patterns in our decisions
about which is which.

---
class: guess
~~~python
>>> def movie_titleize(phrase):
...     capitalized = phrase.title()
...     return capitalized + ": The Untold Story"
~~~
???
They are both local. One is a parameter to the function, the other is
assigned to on the first line. This type of function, sometimes called
a "pure" function, doesn't need its link to its home module for looking up
variables. Without this associated environment, the function would not be a
closure, and here we find out first fork in the definition of the word. Is
a function a closure if it has this link to its defining environment but
that environment is never used? So some would say functions require free
variables to be closures, others that the combination of code and environment
is enough, so long as this
link to home module is there.

---
class: guess
~~~python
>>> def movie_titleize(phrase):
...     capitalized = phrase.title()
...     return capitalized + ": The Untold Story"
~~~
???
For an altogether different reason,
most would say that none of the functions we have seen so far are closures.
So don't touch that dial!

---

#Be the interpreter

~~~python
>>> def movie_titleize(phrase):
...     capitalized = phrase.title()

('phrase', 'capitalized')
>>> movie_titleize.__code__.co_names

We can check our answer by looking at the attribute of the `__code__` object.
Attributes also go in co_names, it's a bit of a catchall

if it's a parameter or is ever assigned to in the function,
it's a local variable. Otherwise it's global.

Let's check our answers, yep.

This is not a pure function, it has free variables.
If you found this function in some code and were to
copy and paste it into your file, it wouldn't work right?
It wouldn't have the right environment.

#Python 2.0 Scope Expert
#MM (the year 2000)

???
Well then congratulations, that's all there is to scope all the way up to Python 2.0.
Python functions have always closed over their their module-level environments, and
there were no big changes in how scope worked up to Python 2.0.

But in Python 2.0 an important method of closing free variables wasn't available to
us, one required by most people to classify a function as a closure:
closing over outer scopes that are not the global scope.

Here's a function that may look familiar if you've seen from my favorite of Ned Batchelder's

#buildings

is buildings a local or a global variable?

well that's the trick question, right?
We'd like it to be neither, we'd like it to be the buildings
variable from surrounding scope.

What do you think happens when we run this?

---

  File "tmp3.py", line 7, in height

Since `buildings` is not a local variable it is assumed to be global
in Python 2.0 and calling it produces this error.

---

# local variables: `func.__code__.co_varnames`
# "phone home" global variables: `func.__code__.co_names`
# "phone home" outer non-global scopes: `func.__code__.co_freevars`

???
Optionally in Python 2.1 as a `__future__` import, then by default in Python
2.2, variables from outer non-global scopes were added and are found at
`.__code__.co_freevars`:


---

~~~python
>>> height.__code__.co_varnames
('name',)
>>> height.__code__.co_names
()
>>> height.__code__.co_freevars
('buildings',)
~~~

???
Once that function finally compiles it looks like this

---

???
Now that we're closing over these scopes, we've got all the outer scopes covered:
we're definitely talking about closures now.

Usually when people talk about closures, they aren't thinking about module-level
scope, or rather they might say that module-level "global" variables are a special case.

It's probably fair to treat global variables as a special case because in Python their implementation is a special case; storing the global environment is much easier.

---

???

You may already be familiar with module
objects in Python: generally they're singletons, so a given module has only
one mapping of variables to values. But a function can be run many times,
producing many different mappings of variables to values.
A different environment must be tracked for each invocation of
the function that produces function objects.

---

~~~python
formatters = {}
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
for color in colors:
    def in_color(s):
        return ('<span style="color:' +
                color + '">' + s + '</span>')
    formatters[color] = in_color


*formatters['green']('hello')
~~~
???
The code creates several functions for displaying text in color in html.
What color will this green formatting function be?

---

~~~python
formatters = {}
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
for color in colors:
    def in_color(s):
        return ('<span style="color:' +
                color + '">' + s + '</span>')
    formatters[color] = in_color

*print(color)
formatters['green']('hello')
~~~
???
It helps to consider the value of the global color variable when the for loop
has finished. What's the value of color here?

So no matter which formatting function we call, the text is going to be in blue.
If we want each function to have its own value associated with the color variable,
then we need separate scopes for each function definition:
---

~~~
formatters = {}
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
*def make_color_func(color):
    def in_color(s):
        return ('<span style="color:' +
                color + '">' + s + '</span>')
    return in_color

for color in colors:
    formatters[color] = make_color_func(color)

formatters['green']('hello')
~~~

???
Each time the `make_color_func` function is called, a new local mapping
is created binding color to one of red, green or blue; a function called
`in_color` is defined which references the color variable in this outer scope;
and the `in_color` function is returned and stuck in a dictionary.
---
class: threemoons
![](./threemoons.jpg)
~~~
formatters = {}
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
def make_color_func(color):
    def in_color(s):
        return ('<span style="color:' +
                color + '">' + s + '</span>')
    return in_color

for color in colors:
    formatters[color] = make_color_func(color)

formatters['green']('hello')
~~~

???
So there are three new environments, shown here as three moons of the global scope planet.
And unlike with modules, there isn't a corresponding namespace object that just has the bindings.

---
class: widecode

~~~
>>> height.__closure__
(<cell at 0x10e6f67f8: dict object at 0x10e72cd88>,)
~~~

???

Precisely how these are maintained by Python is out of scope for this talk,
but the `.__closure__` attribute on the three produced functions provides some
hint. If a function has this attribute set to something other than None then it
has free variables which refer to bindings in outer, non-global scopes.


---

???
We've reached the most common definition of a closure: a function with
free variables closed by an outer, non-global scope.
However another fork in definitions occurs here: some would call our three
color functions closures and but not the earlier height function because it was used
in the same scope it was defined. Although CPython doesn't implement the two any
differently, you could imagine that it becomes more difficult to maintain the
environment a function needs to evaluate its variables once the bindings it needs
goes out of scope. The distinction here is that looking up the stack instead
of the "closure" solution of code + environment would result in the same
behavior in the first case, making whether a function was a closure or not
only distinguishable in the second case.

##Read-only closures
##"weak support" for closures

???
You might have heard that Python has
"weak support" for closures, or Python has "read-only" closures, not "full"
closures. This comes from an asymmetry between global variables and outer
non-global variables, which I will hereto refer to as "nonlocal" variables.

There's still one more thing we can't do, a way that our Python closures are more limited than those of some other languages.

---

???
Remember the problem with global variables, where if we want to assign to a global variable in a function we need to say "global"?
If we didn't have that global keyword our global variables were "read-only?"
Not being able to assign to a nonlocal variables because that would make it a local variables leads to the phrase "read-only" closures.
We can access those variables, and if they're mutable objects we can send them
messages, we can mutate them - but we can't rebind them.

Add a hint to the Python interpreter when we define the function:
we mean the outer variable, not a new one.
Without `nonlocal`, nonlocal variables cannot be rebound to new values.

"rebinding closures"

As with the global keyword the change in semantics may seem small, but its
lack is met with incredulity in Python 2 by those familiar with closures in
other languages. As we find our closure with what closures are and whether
they exist in Python, a new question arises: how did we get on without them
for so long?

Closures are used all over the place.
We can inspect a function for its `.__closure__` attribute
to see if it contains free variables that are closed by outer, nonlocal
scopes.

???
Decorators always take a function as an argument and often define a new
function to replace it, which itself typically holds a reference to the old
function through a free variable from the outer function scope of the
decorator.

There is one more aspect I'm staring to want closure on: how did we get along
without `nonlocal` for so long? Many people still use Python 2 code, how do they
get along without it? And in Python 3 code,

---
class: huge center

#Why isn't nonlocal used much?

???
Adding the nonlocal keyword took nine years, from Python 2.2 in 2001 to Python 3 in 2008.
If it's so important a change, why don't we see a ton of code using it now?

Even now that the nonlocal
is here, the need for compatibility with Python 2 code that many library authors
have prevents some uses. Consider this abridged excerpt from Django:
---
class: widecode

~~~python
def decorating_function(user_function):
    ...
    nonlocal_root = [root] # make updateable non-locally

    def wrapper():
        nonlocal_root[0] = oldroot[NEXT]
        ...
~~~
heavily abridged [Django code](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/utils/lru_cache.py#L80) from utils/lru_cache.py

???
Real-world examples often use the *pattern* of nonlocal, but do it with
a workaround: stick the variable in a mutable object!


---

???
We already have modules and the global keyword,
a bigger one is that we have a nice object system (method binding)...

If you need a callback that changes some state, instead of using nonlocal
we'll often take that state and stick it in an object, and use methods
to telegraph that we're modifying state.

def tallest_building():

                 'Abraj Al-Bait': 601}

    return max(buildings.keys(), key=buildings.get)
~~~

???
(explain this)

And finally I posit a cultural reason: Python programmers tend to be
comfortable with private data being externally accessible. Python and
JavaScript are relatively similar languages, and both lack (or in certain
versions have lacked) private object data which can be accessed by methods
of the object by not by outside code, instead using conventions like a single
underscore to inform users that such a variable is not part of the public
interface with that object.

There's a pattern that uses nonlocal that in both languages is possible,
pattern is possible, but in JavaScript it is commonplace while in Python it is
unheard of.

The next code sample is the most complicated one we've seen yet.

...         age = age + 1
...     p.birthday = birthday
...     p.greet = lambda: print("Hi, I'm", age)
...     return p
... 
>>> me = create_person('Tom')
>>> me.birthday()
>>> me.age
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'Problem' object has no attribute 'age'

Now this is totally possible in JavaScript and Python. But culturally we
