I used [remark](http://rema.com/) for these slides because I was worried about
tweaking reveal.js slide CSS in the limited time I had. I ended up preferring
the remark presentor tools as well.

I wrote custom js for changing the highlighted line in code samples, and at
[Ned Batchelder's suggestion](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201504/how_i_make_presentations.html)
remapped the volume controls on my presenter remote to keys I could catch in
the web browser that remark didn't already use.

You're welcome to give this presentation yourself, just please mention that I
gave it first. I've had a lot of fun giving interactive versions of
presentations I didn't wrote for small groups that wanted to interupt with questions.
